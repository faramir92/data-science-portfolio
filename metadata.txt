We are Data Scientists conducting a research of how US companies hire and apply for working visa for foreign workers. Our objective is to find interesting patterns in given data. 

We have been supplied with three real datasets:
 - The result of 2016 applications for H1B visas;
 - NAICS codes;
 - US States;

Our analysis must be able to address the following questions:

1. What are the top 10 occupations for H1B visas with certified status?
2. Which company hires more data scientists? 
3. What is the average salary for data scientists? How it is compared to the mean of applications?
4. Which state has the higher deny proportionally to application. And proportionally to the population?
5. What industries are in the top 5 percentile of applications?
6. Does the month of the application play any role in to denied process? What about decision dates?
