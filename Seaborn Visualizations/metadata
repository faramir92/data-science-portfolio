The dataset we are using is a very useful tool and relevant to many industries and organization due to the impact and importance of food production. Overall, the world population is expected to grow to roughly 9.7  billion in the year 2050. Finding solutions for feeding the growing world population has become a hot topic for food and agriculture organizations, entrepreneurs and philanthropists. These solutions range from changing the way we grow our food to changing the way we eat. To make things harder, the world's climate is changing and it is both affecting and affected by the way we grow our food â€“ agriculture. 

This dataset provides an insight on our worldwide food production - focusing on a comparison between food produced for human consumption and feed produced for animals. To obtain the file needed you can visit https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production/data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has worldwide food and feed distribution by country and food item from 1961 to 2016 including geocoding.
